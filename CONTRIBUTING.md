Code guide
----------

- Indent by two spaces

- Always use pure YAML &mdash; i.e. write this:

  ```
  copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  ```

  ...not this:

  ```
  copy: src=/srv/myfiles/foo.conf dest=/etc/foo.conf
  ```

- Only quote if necessary:

  * String starts with a YAML control character: `-`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `*`, `&`, `?`, `|`, `>`, `!`, `%`, <code>&#96;</code>, `#`, `@`, `:`

  * String contains colon `:` followed by space

  * String is boolean value (`yes`, `false`, ...) which should be preserved as string

  * String in Jinja2 / `when:` / `until:` statement

- Adhere to following order of declarations:

  ```
  - name: tag | Task description
    vars:
      var-1: ...
      var-2: ...
    task:
      task-param-1: ...
      task-param-2: ...
    notify: ...
    register: ...
    when: ...
    with_items: ...
    run_once: ...
    delegate_to: ...
    delegate_facts: ...
    changed_when: ...
    failed_when: ...
  ```
